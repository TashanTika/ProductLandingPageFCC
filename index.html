        <br>
        There's plenty of power under the hood of the Samsung Galaxy A71, with an octa-core processor and 6GB of RAM (some regions will get 8GB) in the driving seat.

        The device comes running Android 10, which felt fluid and fast under-finger, and you also get 128GB of storage to play with which, for many, will be more than enough. 

        If you do run out of space, the Galaxy A71 also has a microSD slot which supports cards up to 512GB in size.
