        <strong>Performance and specs</strong>

        There's plenty of power under the hood of the Samsung Galaxy A71, with an octa-core processor and 6GB of RAM (some regions will get 8GB) in the driving seat.

        The device comes running Android 10, which felt fluid and fast under-finger, and you also get 128GB of storage to play with which, for many, will be more than enough. 

        If you do run out of space, the Galaxy A71 also has a microSD slot which supports cards up to 512GB in size.

        <strong>Samsung Galaxy A71 release date and price</strong>
        <br>
        Pre-orders for the A71 have now lone live in the UK, costing £419. Other countries including the US are now likely to follow soon. It seems that it will be available before the Galaxy S11 launch though in a couple of days, which is taking place on February 11.

        The Samsung Galaxy A71 price is £419 (around $550, AU$800), making it competitive in the market for the features it's offering. This should translate into equally strong contract deals as well, but we'll have to wait to find out exactly how much they'll be.
